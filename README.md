# Optimization-of-the-Observation-of-CMB-radiation-taken-from-an-aerostatic-ballon
On this paper we tried to optimize the observation on CMB done on 13 days of mission by an aerostatic ballon simulating the total sky coverage and the quality of the pixel taken using a software developed on purpose by some of our teachers.
The software simulated a .dat file associated to a map of the sky coverage taken from the detectors trough the mission time, we built some software for analyzing the quality of the pixels taken during the observation by trying to minimize the noise on them while maximizing the time on each.
